<p><b>Activity
2 Deficit approaches and pathologising minorities</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>In
the 70s, Bakan and colleagues have published a number of highly influential articles
that patologised left handedness. Their claims, which were later revoked (e.g.,
Bishop, 1990), included that left handedness results from birth trauma and a
minor brain damage. Below are some of their papers that discussed the ideas. Discuss how implicit bias may influence methods that are applied by scientists and how this could skew results. </i></p>

 </ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>What effect, do you think, this had on the
public perceptions of left handedness in the 70s and 80s? And what impact did
it have on the population? And the progress of research in the area? </i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><i>Can you think of other areas where implicit bias perpetuated in language (has) had a detrimental impact on public perceptions? What groups of
people might have been affected?</i></p><br><p></p><br><p></p>

<p><i>Are neurotypical and neurodivergent populations
perceived equally by the authors or is one of the groups given as a model and
the other compared to it by looking at their deficits?</i></p><p><i><br></i></p>

 <p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><i> What is the assumed norm that autistic individuals are measured against? Is this explicitly stated anywhere? Norms are developed based on observations gathered through research. Where is most research conducted? Which populations is it mainly conducted on? Which groups may be underrepresented or purposefully excluded from studies? How does this affect norms? Normative science is pervasive in many fields. Pay attention to assumed standards and implicit bias in articles you read. How can we become more aware of our own biases?
