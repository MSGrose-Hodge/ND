<p><b>Activity
2 Deficit approaches and patologising minority groups</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>In
the 70s, Bakan and colleagues have published a number of highly influential articles
that patologised left handedness. Their claims, which were later revoked (e.g.,
Bishop, 1990), included that left handedness results from birth trauma and a
minor brain damage. Below are some of their papers that discussed the ideas:</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>Bakan, P (1971) Handedness and Birth Order.&nbsp;<i>Nature</i>&nbsp;229(195).
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/229195a0">https://doi.org/10.1038/229195a0</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bakan P (1975) Are left-handers brain damaged?&nbsp;<em>New
Scientist</em>&nbsp;67(1): 200–202.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bakan P, Dibb G, Reed P (1973) Handedness and birth stress.&nbsp;<em>Neuropsychologia</em>&nbsp;11(3):
363–366.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Below is part of an abstract to one of the
papers (Bakan, 1971). Read it and underline parts where language that suggests
patology is used. Can you see any ableist language used in this abstract? </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The frequency of left-handedness is greater in
males and in twin births, both of which are also associated with greater birth
and infant mortality and, in the case of males, a higher rate of spontaneous
abortion. The pre-natal and peri-natal periods seem to be more stressful for
these groups. Left-handedness is also associated with language disorders such
as stuttering, dyslexia, and mental retardation, conditions where central
nervous system pathology may be implicated<sup>1</sup>. This suggests that the incidence of
left-handedness might be correlated with stressful pre-natal and birth
conditions. Such difficulties are most characteristic of primiparous births
(longer labour and more use of instruments) and births to older mothers. Thus
high risk birth orders would be the first born and the late-born (defined here
as fourth or later birth).”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>What effect, do you think, this had on the
public perceptions of left handedness in the 70s and 80s? And what impact did
it have on the population? And the progress of research in the area? </i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><i>Can you think of other areas where implicit
bias / patologising language (has) had a detrimental impact on? What groups of
people might have been affected?</i></p><br><p></p><br><p></p>
