<p><b>Activity
2 Deficit approaches and patologising minority groups</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>In
the 70s, Bakan and colleagues have published a number of highly influential articles
that patologised left handedness. Their claims, which were later revoked (e.g.,
Bishop, 1990), included that left handedness results from birth trauma and a
minor brain damage. Below are some of their papers that discussed the ideas:</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>Bakan, P (1971) Handedness and Birth Order.&nbsp;<i>Nature</i>&nbsp;229(195).
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/229195a0">https://doi.org/10.1038/229195a0</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bakan P (1975) Are left-handers brain damaged?&nbsp;<em>New
Scientist</em>&nbsp;67(1): 200–202.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bakan P, Dibb G, Reed P (1973) Handedness and birth stress.&nbsp;<em>Neuropsychologia</em>&nbsp;11(3):
363–366.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Below is part of an abstract to one of the
papers (Bakan, 1971). Read it and underline parts where language that suggests
patology is used. Can you see any ableist language used in this abstract? </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The frequency of left-handedness is greater in
males and in twin births, both of which are also associated with greater birth
and infant mortality and, in the case of males, a higher rate of spontaneous
abortion. The pre-natal and peri-natal periods seem to be more stressful for
these groups. Left-handedness is also associated with language disorders such
as stuttering, dyslexia, and mental retardation, conditions where central
nervous system pathology may be implicated<sup>1</sup>. This suggests that the incidence of
left-handedness might be correlated with stressful pre-natal and birth
conditions. Such difficulties are most characteristic of primiparous births
(longer labour and more use of instruments) and births to older mothers. Thus
high risk birth orders would be the first born and the late-born (defined here
as fourth or later birth).”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>What effect, do you think, this had on the
public perceptions of left handedness in the 70s and 80s? And what impact did
it have on the population? And the progress of research in the area? </i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><i>Can you think of other areas where implicit
bias / patologising language (has) had a detrimental impact on? What groups of
people might have been affected?</i></p><br><p></p><br><p></p>

<p><b>Activity 3 Neurodiversity paradigm: definition and introduction</b></p>
 
 <p><br></p><p><i>Look at the definition of neurodiversity from
the FORRT (Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training) website and a
twitter thread from the same research group and discuss / reflect on these
questions:</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><i>Can you explain what neurodiversity is in your
own words?</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><i>What is the difference between neurodiversity and neurodivergence?</i></p>

<p><i>What does it mean that an individual is neurodivergent?</i></p>

<p><i>Look at the wheel from the group’s Twitter thread and either discuss it
with in pairs or reflect on it. Are you included in the wheel? </i></p><br><p></p>
 
<div>
  <img src="defandtwt.png" alt="top: Neurodiversity is the non-pathological variation in the human brain regarding sociability, learning, attention, mood and other mental functions at a group level (Singer, 2017). An individual is neurodivergent if their neurology diverges from that of the neurological majority. Neurodiversity is critically relevant to the social sciences as it discusses the diverse cognitive behaviours forming the foundations of what it means to be unique and human. Importantly, the neurodiversity movement questions the assumption that all humans must conform to the same expectations in order to flourish. Bottom: A multicoloured sphere showing examples of neurodiversity. Neurotypicality along with a selection of neurodivergent conditions are listed: Developmental Co-ordination Disorder/Condition, Personality Disorders/Conditions, Developmental Language Disorder/Condition, Bipolar Disorder/Condition, Anxiety and Depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Condition, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder/Condition, Autism, Stuttering and Cluttering, Tourette’s syndrome and Tics, Panic Disorders/Conditions, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia." width="300" height="1200">

the authors see individuals with neurotypes other than neurotypical? </i></p><p><i><br></i></p>

<p><i> What is the assumed norm that autistic individuals are measured against? Is this explicitly stated anywhere? Norms are developed based on observations gathered through research. Where is most research conducted? Which populations is it mainly conducted on? Which groups may be underrepresented or purposefully excluded from studies? How does this affect norms? Normative science is pervasive in many fields. Pay attention to assumed standards and implicit bias in articles you read. How can we become more aware of our own biases?
